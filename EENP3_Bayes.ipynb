    "Bayesian probability is an interpretation on the nature of probability, so rather than being a direct measure of the liklihood of some phenomenon, probability is interpretted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge. This sounds complicated but what it really means is simply that for a hypothesis which may or may not be true it has a probability assigned to it, and as new information is discovered the certainty of the hypothesis changes. The alternative to this being the frequentist approach which usually tests a hypothesis without assigning a probability to the hypothesis, we won't be covering frequentist inference in this notebook although you will have already used it even if you weren't aware at the time. If you would like to learn more on it see the wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference."
